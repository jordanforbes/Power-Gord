# Power Gord is Music Theory With a Mullet.

Ultimately this will have a reverse chord/scale search utilizing tonal.js as a library.

TODO:
Currently the reverse search function does not work, and only the scale search function correctly displays on the fretboard. This will be changed soon.

But the scale search does.

## How to use

1. select Root note on the fretboard

2. select desired scale in the scroll-box, this should turn all of the notes in that scale Red, as well as print all of the notes in the scale in the display box.

3. select Swap Modes to switch from Scale to Chord mode.

4. use the Chord mode in the same way as scale mode, however at this stage it will not properly highlight the notes on the fretboard. The notes will still be printed in the display box.

4. select clear to bring the fretboard back to its default state.
